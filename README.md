For my first task at CodeAlpha's data science internship, I focused on analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict survival outcomes using various machine learning techniques.
I began by importing the dataset ('train.csv') into a pandas DataFrame and performed initial data exploration to understand its structure and contents. 
This involved checking for missing values and handling them appropriately, such as imputing median values for age and dropping irrelevant columns like 'Name', 'Ticket', 'Cabin',
and 'Embarked'.
I then engineered new features where relevant, such as extracting titles from names to create a 'Title' feature, and encoding categorical variables like 'Sex' using
one-hot encoding.
For exploratory data analysis (EDA), I visualized relationships between variables using matplotlib and seaborn, plotting survival rates across different passenger classes,
age groups, and genders.
This helped me identify socio-economic status, age, and gender as key factors likely influencing survival. 
Moving to model building, I split the dataset into training and testing sets, selected and trained machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Decision Trees,
and evaluated their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.
Finally, I interpreted the results, highlighting feature importance to determine which factors were most influential in predicting survival on the Titanic. 
Overall, my approach involved a structured workflow of data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, model selection, training, evaluation, and interpretation,
providing insights into the factors contributing to survival on the Titanic.
